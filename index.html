        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>I’m a passionate and curious learner with a growing skill set in web design, web development, and app development. My original focus was design, but I’ve become increasingly intrigued by the possibilities of app development. I’m seeking an internship where I can apply and grow my technical skills through real-world projects.</p>
